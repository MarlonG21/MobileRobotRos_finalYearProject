														List of goals1:
	-building a differential robot with ROS
		a.design the robot and produce URDF file for data visualization in rviz
		a.adding gyro for orientation and calibration
		b.adding an external encoder to avoid position sliding in case the was an obstacle it couldn't detect
		c.building android app to interact with the robot------define what the app will do--------------------------------------------------------------------------------->MAKING LAYOUT FOR THE PHONE APP/PC
																						    SIMPLE TO UNDERSTAND USER INTERFACE:
																						    IMPLEMENTING TELEOPERATION ON THE ROBOT
	-building a detachable manipulator																	    IMPLEMENTING JOGGING FOR MANIPULATOR WITH WINDOW FOR OBJECT DETECTION
		a.design the robot and produce URDF file for data visualization in rviz												    speech to text commands	   
		b.building the manipulato r-with servo(max torque not decided yet) and 3d printer parts										    									    										    
		c.making manipulator wireless
		d.making master communicate to each other

	-pick and place object
		a.detecting object
		a1. detecting distance between camera and object detected--https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1I4gHpctXbU
		b.determine location of object with image processed 
		c.move torwards the object using image processed from camera

	-navigation with an unknown map
		a.processing the data from the array produced for the occupancy grid
		b.define each grid with a list of lists
		c.
		 

Define end user:
in industry-might be teleoperated
for any customer-a development of an up might be required------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>The end user will be a customer & the functional use will be for educational purposes
